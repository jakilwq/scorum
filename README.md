# Introducing Scorum

Scorum platform has three core functions:
 - Blogging platform where authors and readers will be rewarded for creating and engaging with content
 - Statistical centers where fans can browse and authors can use Microsoft’s Power BI tool to integrate data-rich visuals into their content
- Commission-free betting exchange where fans can place bets against each other using Scorum Coins (SCR)
Scorum’s blockchain protocol is built on the Graphene Framework and utilizes a delegated proof of stake consensus.

# Blockchain consensus rules

Rather than attempt to describe the rules of the blockchain, it is up to
each individual to inspect the code to understand the consensus rules.

# Quickstart

Just want to get up and running quickly?  Try deploying a prebuilt
dockerized container.

## Dockerized Node

Create you folder (for example /opt/my_node)

    mkdir /opt/my_node

Put your config file in /opt/my_node/config.ini (otherwise default config will be used). Run node.

    docker run \
        -v /opt/my_node:/var/lib/scorumd \
        -d -p 2001:2001 -p 8090:8090 --name my_node \
        scorum/release:0.1.1.d671c68

To see node logs

    docker logs my_node

For detail logs go to /opt/my_node/logs (or other folder that set in config.ini)

To stop/start/restart node use

    docker stop my_node
    docker start my_node
    docker restart my_node

# Seed Nodes

A list of some seed nodes to get you started can be found in
[seed-nodes](https://github.com/scorum/scorum/wiki/Seeds). This list is embedded into default config.ini.

# Building

See [doc/building.md](doc/building.md) for detailed build instructions, including
compile-time options, and specific commands for Linux (Ubuntu LTS) or macOS X.

# System Requirements

For a full node, you need at least 30GB of space available. Scorumd uses a memory mapped file which currently holds 2GB of data and by default is set to use up to 20GB. It's highly recommended to run scorumd on a fast disk such as an SSD or by placing the shared memory files in a ramdisk and using the `shared-file-dir` config (or command line) option to specify where. Any CPU with decent single core performance should be sufficient.
